    "## Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Land use and land cover (LULC) classification is essential for monitoring agriculture, urban growth, and environmental sustainability. With open-access Sentinel-2 imagery, it is now possible to automate this process using deep learning. The problem is formulated as a **supervised multi-class image classification task**: given a Sentinel-2 image patch, predict its land cover type. Using the **EuroSAT dataset** (27,000 labeled patches across ten classes such as *Forest, Residential, River, Sea/Lake, Annual Crop*), this project applies deep learning models—primarily CNNs—to learn spectral and spatial patterns that distinguish land types.\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "EuroSAT provides 64×64 pixel patches from Sentinel-2 imagery across Europe, labeled into ten diverse land cover classes. The task is challenging due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Intra-class variability** (e.g., crops look different across seasons).\n",
    "* **Inter-class similarity** (e.g., Residential vs. Industrial areas).\n",
    "* **High dimensionality** of multispectral data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, Sentinel-2’s rich spectral bands and EuroSAT’s curated labels make it an ideal benchmark for developing scalable LULC classification models. The project scope is patch-level classification (one label per image), forming a basis for automated land cover mapping.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Handling**: Preprocess EuroSAT data (RGB and multispectral), normalize inputs, and apply augmentation.\n",
    "2. **Model Development**: Implement a CNN with transfer learning, adapted for 3-band or 13-band inputs, focusing on accuracy and efficiency.\n",
    "3. **Training & Evaluation**: Train on labeled data, evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to ensure balanced performance.\n",
    "4. **Refinement**: Experiment with architectures (e.g., CNN vs. ViT) and multispectral vs. RGB inputs.\n",
    "5. **Application**: Demonstrate use cases in agriculture monitoring, urban planning, and environmental analysis, linking outputs to sustainability goals.\n",
